With https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1686242 for API access to package buildinfo files directly
I am archiving this repo. it is replaced with https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-package-buildinfo which uses

Tool to retrieve Ubuntu package buildlog info

Ubuntu package builds currently do not publish a buildinfo file. However, the buildlog file contains
the contents buildinfo file. This script downloads the buildlog file, extracts the buildinfo file and verifies
that the buildinfo file is correct based on the checksum in the .changes file.

See https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/BuildinfoFiles for more information on buildinfo files.

Launchpad.net bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/2044140 is to track the progress of publishing buildinfo
files.
